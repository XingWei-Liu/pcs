  Totem_consensus: This timeout specifies in milliseconds how long to wait for consensus to be achieved before starting a new round of membership configuration. The minimum value for consensus must be 1.2 * token. This value will be automatically calculated at 1.2 * token if the user doesn't specify a consensus value.<br/><br/>For two node clusters, a consensus larger than the join timeout but less than token is safe. For three node or larger clusters, consensus should be larger than token. There is an increasing risk of odd membership changes, which still guarantee virtual synchrony, as node count grows if consensus is less than token.<br/><br/>The default is 1200 milliseconds.
